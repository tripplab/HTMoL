# HTMoL

## NEXT-GENERATION MOLECULAR DYNAMICS WEB VISUALIZATION

HTMoL is a light-weight full-stack plugin-free application to display the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of biomolecules. HTMoL can be used as a graphical interface to access MD data located at a high performance computing cluster where simulations are generated, or as supplementary documentation for scientific research publications as a way to readily share MD results. 

Developed by integrating state-of-the-art web technologies ( NodeJS + WebGL + JavaScript + HTML5 + CSS3 ), HTMoL is easy to install, configure and customize on any web-server. HTMoL can be embedded inside a web page or used full-size, and it does not require any other third-party package to be installed on the client-side. It works in all popular web browsers. Chrome or FireFox highly recommended.
